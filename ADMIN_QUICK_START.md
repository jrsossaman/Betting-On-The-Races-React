## ✅ All Implementation Complete

All 7 major components have been implemented. The system is ready for testing!

---

## 🧪 Quick Testing

### 1. Create Admin Account
```bash
cd backend
node seed-admin.js
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or: npm run dev
```

### 3. Create Test User (via API)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users?teamId=2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "test123",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'
```

### 4. Test Admin Functions
In React frontend:
- Login as `admin` / `AdminPassword123!`
- Click "👑 Admin" button in navigation
- See admin panel with all users
- Try suspending a test user
- Try unsuspending them
- Try deleting them

### 5. Verify API Compatibility
All existing endpoints continue to work:
- ✅ POST /api/users - Create user
- ✅ GET /api/users - List users (excludes suspended/deleted)
- ✅ GET /api/users/:id - Get user by ID
- ✅ GET /api/users/username/:username - Get by username (checks status)
- ✅ PUT /api/users/:id - Update user
- ✅ DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete user (soft delete)
- ✅ GET /get/all - Legacy endpoint (returns active users only)
