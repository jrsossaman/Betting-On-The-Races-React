## Frontend API Integration Status

All frontend API calls have been verified against the backend:

| Frontend Module | API Calls | Status |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| `create_user.jsx` | POST /api/users | ✅ |

## Configuration Verified

- ✅ **API URL:** http://localhost:5001 (configurable via REACT_APP_API_URL)
- ✅ **CORS:** Enabled for cross-origin requests
- ✅ **Content-Type:** application/json
- ✅ **MongoDB URI:** Connected to local/configured instance

---

## Performance Observations

- ✅ All endpoints respond within acceptable timeframe
- ✅ No timeout issues detected
- ✅ Database queries optimized with indexes
- ✅ Error handling prevents cascading failures

---

## Security Considerations

- ✅ User password validation implemented
- ✅ Admin authorization checks in place
- ✅ Account status enforcement (active/suspended/deleted)
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ⚠️ **Note:** Consider implementing JWT authentication for enhanced security in future updates

---

## Recommendations Before Production

1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure `.env` file is properly configured with:
   - `MONGODB_URI` pointing to production database
   - `PORT` set appropriately for production (default: 5001)
   - `NODE_ENV` set to `production`

2. **Database Backups:** Set up automatic MongoDB backups

3. **Monitoring:** Implement server monitoring and logging for production

4. **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints

5. **HTTPS:** Ensure production deployment uses HTTPS

6. **Security Headers:** Add security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

---
