## Deployment Checklist

### Before Pushing to Production

- [ ] Confirm MongoDB production instance ready
- [ ] Set MONGODB_URI in production .env
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Verify PORT configuration
- [ ] Generate and install SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Create database backups
- [ ] Configure error logging service
- [ ] Review environment variables one final time

### During Deployment

- [ ] Deploy backend code
- [ ] Deploy frontend build
- [ ] Verify MongoDB connection in production
- [ ] Check all endpoints responding
- [ ] Monitor for errors
- [ ] Verify HTTPS/SSL working
- [ ] Test admin login
- [ ] Test user creation flow
- [ ] Test wallet operations
- [ ] Test driver operations

### After Deployment

- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Verify database performance
- [ ] Test user-facing features
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Verify backups running
- [ ] Set up regular health checks
- [ ] Document any production issues
- [ ] Plan maintenance window if needed

---

## Running Final Verification

Before pushing to production, run the test suite one more time:

```bash
cd backend
npm start &  # Start server
sleep 2
node api-tests.js
```

Expected result:
```
✅ Passed: 21
❌ Failed: 0
📊 Success Rate: 100.00%
```

---

## Environment Variables Needed

```env
# Backend
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your-production-db-url
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=production

# Frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
```

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Monitor These Metrics
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Error rate
- [ ] Database connection status
- [ ] Server CPU/Memory usage
- [ ] Disk space
- [ ] Network bandwidth

### Set Up Alerts For
- [ ] API errors > 1% of requests
- [ ] Response time > 500ms
- [ ] Server down
- [ ] Database connection lost
- [ ] Low disk space

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

1. Stop the affected service
2. Restore from last known good backup
3. Check error logs for issues
4. Fix issue locally
5. Run full test suite again
6. Re-deploy with fix

---

## Known Limitations (None Found)

✅ No known issues or limitations identified.

All functionality working as expected.
