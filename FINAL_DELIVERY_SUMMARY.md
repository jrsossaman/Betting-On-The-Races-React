## 📋 Complete Change Log

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `backend/models/User.js`
**Changes:** Added two new schema fields
```javascript
// NEW: Admin role flag
isAdmin: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false,
  required: true,
}

// NEW: Account status tracking
accountStatus: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['active', 'suspended', 'deleted'],
  default: 'active',
  required: true,
}
```
**Impact:** Enables user status management without breaking changes

---

#### 2. `backend/server.js`
**Changes:** Added admin endpoints and status checks

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/admin/suspend/:userId` - Suspend user (requires admin verification)
- `POST /api/admin/unsuspend/:userId` - Restore suspended user
- `POST /api/admin/delete/:userId` - Mark user as permanently deleted
- `GET /api/admin/users/active?adminId=...` - Get users by status

**Helper Function:**
```javascript
const verifyAdmin = async (adminId) => {
  // Ensures admin exists, is authorized, and is active
}
```

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `/api/users/username/:username` - Now returns 403 for suspended, 404 for deleted
- `/get/all` - Now filters to active users only
- `/delete/user` - Now performs soft delete instead of hard delete

**Impact:** All admin operations protected by authorization checks

---

#### 3. `backend/seed-admin.js` (NEW)
**Purpose:** Script to create initial admin account
**Features:**
- Creates admin with default credentials
- Checks if admin already exists
- Displays account details after creation
- Can be run once safely (idempotent)

**Usage:**
```bash
node backend/seed-admin.js
```

**Impact:** Simplifies initial setup of admin account

---

#### 4. `backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
**Changes:** Added comprehensive admin endpoint documentation

**Added Sections:**
- Admin Management Endpoints section (400+ lines)
- Authorization & account status explanation
- Request/response examples for all admin operations
- cURL testing commands for admin endpoints
- Admin account creation documentation
- Security best practices

**Impact:** Complete API reference for admin features

---

### Frontend Changes

#### 5. `src/context/race_betting_context.jsx`
**Changes:** Added admin management methods

**New Methods:**
```javascript
getAllUsers()                    // Fetch all users by status
suspendUser(userId, adminId)    // Call suspend endpoint
unsuspendUser(userId, adminId)  // Call unsuspend endpoint
deleteUserPermanently(userId, adminId) // Call delete endpoint
```

**Context Updates:**
- Added methods to context value object
- Each method includes error handling
- Local state updates after successful operations

**Impact:** Frontend can now call admin operations via context

---

#### 6. `src/components/admin_panel.jsx` (NEW)
**Purpose:** Admin user management interface
**Features:**
- Three tabs: Active | Suspended | Deleted users
- User list with avatars, names, wallets, status
- Action buttons: Suspend/Unsuspend/Delete
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Real-time user list updates
- Error/success message feedback
- Loading states

**UI Components:**
- Admin header with description
- Tab navigation system
- User card with action buttons
- Confirmation dialog modal
- Status badges
- Empty states

**Impact:** Professional admin UI for user management

---

#### 7. `src/app.jsx`
**Changes:** Updated navigation for admin access

**Changes:**
- Imported AdminPanel component
- Added conditional "👑 Admin" button (only visible to admin users)
- Added "admin" view state handling
- Updated view rendering to show admin panel

**Code:**
```javascript
{user.isAdmin && (
  <button onClick={() => setActiveView("admin")}>
    👑 Admin
  </button>
)}

{activeView === "admin" && <AdminPanel />}
```

**Impact:** Seamless admin panel integration into navigation
