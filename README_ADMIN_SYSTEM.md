## 🔑 Key Features

### Account Status System
Three distinct states for flexible user management:
- **Active** → User can login and access the platform
- **Suspended** → User blocked from access (admin can restore)
- **Deleted** → Account marked as deleted (data preserved for recovery)

### Admin Operations
- 🚫 **Suspend** - Temporarily disable user access
- ✅ **Unsuspend** - Restore previously suspended user
- 🗑️ **Delete** - Permanently mark account as deleted
- 👁️ **View** - See all users organized by status

### Security Features
- Admin ID verification on every operation
- Admins cannot be suspended/deleted by other admins
- Status-aware login validation
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Soft deletes preserve data integrity

⚠️ **Change password immediately after first login!**

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
npm start
# or: npm run dev
```

### 3. Login as Admin
- Use credentials from step 1
- Look for "👑 Admin" button in navigation (only visible to admin users)

### 4. Access Admin Panel
- Click "👑 Admin" button
- See all users organized in 3 tabs
- Manage accounts with suspend/unsuspend/delete buttons

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

✅ **Authorization System**
- Admin operations require valid admin verification
- Admins protected from accidental suspension/deletion
- Every request validated

✅ **Data Integrity**
- Soft deletes preserve all historical data
- Race history and statistics remain intact
- Recovery possible for suspended/deleted accounts

✅ **API Security**
- Status-aware responses (403 for suspended, 404 for deleted)
- Proper error codes and messages
- Protected admin endpoints

---

## 📱 User Experience

### For Admins
```
Login → Click "👑 Admin" Button → Admin Panel Opens

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run seed script to create admin account
- [ ] Login as admin and verify "👑 Admin" button appears
- [ ] Create a test user via API
- [ ] Suspend test user and verify login fails
- [ ] Unsuspend user and verify login succeeds
- [ ] Delete user and verify login fails
- [ ] Verify all existing APIs still work
- [ ] Test with normal user (no admin button)
